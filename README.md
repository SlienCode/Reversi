# Reversi
![Board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80926890/192098856-3590c167-7139-4268-b031-0816d9f35a90.png)

In this Artificial Intelligence assignment we had to implement the game known as Reversi, a game board for it and an AI that uses the MiniMax algorithm in order to predict the next best possible move and play the game against a human player. The user can choose if they want to go first (in which case they'll play using the black pawns) or second (white pawns). The user can also choose the depth the algorithm searches at, in order to increase the difficulty of the game. More specifically :
- depth = 2 is easy mode
- depth = 4 is medium mode
- depth = 6 is hard mode

Any other depth might cause long waiting times as the AI searches further deep into the tree in order to find the best possible move.

Instructions :
1. download all java files and place them in the same folder.
2. compile and run Main.java
3. Move inputs work as follows : you input the move as shown in the icon above , rows are numbers , columns are letters
example : row 3 col D (3D) etc like chess.
